## Tasks

`/tasks.ipynb`

Jupyter notebook for the four different tasks for the semester. All the solutions are provided using the Python Programming Language. 
### Task1 Collatz Conjecture

This conjecture tries to prove that using two simple operation, any positive integer can be transformed to 1
### Task2 Newton's Method for Square Root Approximation

Evaluating the square root of a given integer using Newton's method
### Task3 Evaluating function from a Black Box

Given a black box that runs a function, this tasks seeks to determine which particular function was used by continuously evaluating the function until one can reasonably conclude which function it was. 
### Task4 Matrix Multiplication using Lists in Python

Matrix multiplication using lists as matrix in Python Programming language. 


## Project - Deutsch's Algorithm

`/project.ipynb`

In this section of this repository the Deutsch's Algorithm is explored. The problem definition of the Algorithm was introduced using a more general algorithm namely the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm, which a broader implementation of the Deutsch's Algorithm. The significant difference being that while the Deutsch's Algorithm is only implemented for a single bit system, the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm works on multiple bits. 

The structure of the notebook can be summarize below

## Introduction

The problem statement and algorithm is introduced as explained.

## Classical Information

Classical Information is analyzed and layed out relevant way for eventual quantum alternatives. Basic information involving classical systems is explained using real life scenarios to help get a grasp on how they actually work. 

## Quantum Information

A brief introduction to quantum computing concepts relevant to the topic. 

## Algorithm Implementation

A step by step explanation of the Deutsch's Algorithm and their actual implementation using qiskit.
